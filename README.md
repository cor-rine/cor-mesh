# cor-mesh

Musing inspired by [Matt DesLauriers's SVG 3D Mesg](http://mattdesl.github.io/svg-mesh-3d/) and to get my feet wet with Three.js.  Also a chance to play with [bud≈ç](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo) - which is super nice and easy for rapid prototyping.

### Installation for local development
